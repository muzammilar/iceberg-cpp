/// \brief FileIO that uses the location scheme to choose the concrete FileIO,
/// mirroring Java's ResolvingFileIO.
///
/// Resolution is per file path and independent of `warehouse` (often a logical
/// identifier rather than a storage URI). Implementations are loaded lazily
/// from FileIORegistry with this FileIO's properties and cached. Vended
/// credentials are forwarded in full to every resolved FileIO that supports
/// them; each applies the prefixes it understands and ignores the rest.
///
/// Lazy resolution is internally synchronized, so file operations may run
/// concurrently. Credentials are not: install them before sharing the instance,
/// since credentials() hands out a reference that SetStorageCredentials
/// replaces.
